# The Waterloo Blogger

This Github repo is a [list](//github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) of blogs (or Medium profiles) owned by former or current Waterloo students.

The goals of this repo are to:
- **Improve information diffusion**...for positive net gain for everybody. Blog posts written by Waterloo students are more likely to be relevant and useful to other Waterloo students.
- **Increase readership & discoverability of existing blogs**...and in the process, incentivize more writing.
- **Encourage more students to blog**...by providing a lot of examples and reducing the argument that "no one is going to read my blog". This should be a positive for student culture.

## Contributing

Please contribute to this list by creating a pull request, creating a Github issue or even request an addition via [this anonymous form](//docs.google.com/forms/d/1yZM2G6iFqwm2BKXesU5JWQLJ9xy2HkE0aWPh5fhoD2U)! If you make a pull request, please follow the format of existing links.

For discoverability, we highlight the blogs with **at least 8 posts** (yes, this number is totally arbitrary).

Feel free to tag/describe your blog. Using existing tags makes searching easier, though you can create new tags as you see fit. Try to keep the description under 100 characters.
