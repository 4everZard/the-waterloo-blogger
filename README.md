# The Waterloo Blogger

This Github repo is a [list](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) of blogs (or Medium profiles) owned by former or current Waterloo students.

The goals of this repo are to:
- **Improve information diffusion**...for positive net gain for everybody. Blog posts written by Waterloo students are more likely to be relevant and useful to other Waterloo students.
- **Increase readership & discoverability of existing blogs**...and in the process, incentivize more writing.
- **Encourage more students to blog**...by providing a lot of examples and reducing the argument that "no one is going to read my blog". This should be a positive for student culture.

## Contributing

Please contribute to this list by creating a pull request, creating a Github issue or even request an addition via [this anonymous form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1yZM2G6iFqwm2BKXesU5JWQLJ9xy2HkE0aWPh5fhoD2U)! If you make a pull request, please follow the format of existing links. You can also request to be removed from this list.

For discoverability, we highlight the blogs with **at least 8 posts** (yes, this number is totally arbitrary).

Feel free to tag/describe your blog. Using existing tags makes searching easier, though you can create new tags as you see fit. Try to keep the description under 100 characters.

This text document is just version 1, created as an experiment. I am open to suggestions on how to format the information in this repo to make it more helpful for readers. [More ambitious plans and ideas can be found here](FUTURE.md).
